## Code Style Fixer

You may use the PHP-CS-Fixer to fix your code style before committing.

To get started, install the tool globally and check the code style by issuing the following terminal command from your project's root directory:

    php-cs-fixer fix

# Style-CI

StyleCI provides checks by analyzing every push or pull request made on the repo, and ensures that the code is always written against some standards that help keeping the code clean and shareable.

Don't worry about meeting style at first, PRs will automatically be scanned and fixed for you.
