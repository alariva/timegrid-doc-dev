# Localization (i18n)

The main language is `en_US`. All derived translations should be taken from this
 branch.

Supported languages so far are:

  * English [en_US]
  * Spanish [es_ES]

Possible future languages to include:

  * Italian [it_IT]
  * Portuguese [pt_BR]
  * Catalan [ca_ES]

# Directories

  * Translation key files are located in `resources/lang`
  * Email templates are located in `resources/views/emails` which are as well 
  localized

# Translation Keys Schema

There is currently no proper *translation key schema* set.

So far, the key naming intends to achieve the following goals:

  * **Consistency:** Minimize the possibility of using different words for the 
  same meaning, or creating many different keys that end up having the same 
  translation (like common words).
  * **Reusability:** Minimize the overall translation files size and translate 
  as less as possible, and preserve flexibility.
  * **Readability:** Translators should be able to easily identify the purpose 
  of the key even under lack of the translation value.
  * **Organization:** Developer should easily remember/guess the full key path 
  (or at least the base path) and minimize checking the transalation files each 
  time.

# Updating texts

Simply go to the translation key files or email template and update wordings.

# Adding keys

Follow [Laravel localization](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/localization) 
facilities.

For automatically adding the translation key files, timegrid uses 
[potsky/laravel-localization-helpers](https://github.com/potsky/laravel-localization-helpers/).

You can do this by running

    php artisan localization:missing

Afterwards, edit each modified file to put the proper translation wording.

> **NOTE:** This tool will break PSR-2 standard for translation files. However, 
this [could possibly be fixed in the future](https://github.com/potsky/laravel-localization-helpers/issues/15).

# Adding a new language locale

## Copy from English and Edit method

1. Make sure to get the latest `en_US` translation tree of the project.
1. Copy the tree renaming it to the desired new locale.
1. Edit all keys to update the translations.

## From Scratch Method

1. Create the desired new locale driectory in the two resources locations: 
`lang` and `emails`.
1. Run the *laravel-localization-helpers* to generate the files.
1. Edit all keys to update the translations.

> **NOTE:** This method might omit some dynamically generated keys.
