# Installation

- [Minimum system requirements](#system-requirements)
- [Command-line Installation steps](#command-line-installation)
- [Post-installation steps](#post-install-steps)
    - [Setting up the scheduler](#crontab-setup)

Before you proceed, you should check that your server meets the minimum system requirements.

<a name="system-requirements"></a>
## Minimum system requirements

timegrid has some server requirements for web hosting:

1. PHP >= 5.5.9
1. OpenSSL PHP Extension
1. PDO PHP Extension
1. Mbstring PHP Extension
1. Tokenizer PHP Extension
1. Nginx or Apache web server
1. MySQL server

As of PHP 5.5, some OS distributions may require you to manually install the PHP JSON extension.
When using Ubuntu, this can be done via ``apt-get install php5-json``.

## Command-line installation

* [Step 1: Get the code](#step1)
* [Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies](#step2)
* [Step 3: Create Database](#step3)
* [Step 4: Install](#step4)
* [Step 5: Start Page](#step5)
* [Optional: Populate DB with a Demo Sandbox Data Fixture](#demo-sandbox)

<a name="step1"></a>
### Step 1: Get the code

    git clone https://github.com/alariva/timegrid.git

    cd timegrid

-----
<a name="step2"></a>
### Step 2: Install dependencies with Composer

    composer install

-----
<a name="step3"></a>
### Step 3: Create the Database

Once you finished the first three steps, you can create the *MySQL* database server. You must create the database with `utf-8` collation (`utf8_general_ci`), for the application to work.

<a name="step4"></a>
### Step 4: Configure the Environment

**Copy** the **.env.example** file to **.env**

    cp .env.example .env

**Edit** the `.env` file and set the database configuration among the other settings.

Set the application key

    php artisan key:generate

**Edit** all the Primary section parameters (for *local/test/development environment*)

**Change** the storage path in **.env** file to a writeable location

    STORAGE_PATH=/home/username/timegrid/storage

For **local** environment you will need to **comment out** APP_DOMAIN, to keep it *null*

    #APP_DOMAIN=

Back to your console, **migrate** database schema

    php artisan migrate

**Populate** the database:

    php artisan db:seed
    
**Update** [geoip](https://github.com/Torann/laravel-geoip) database:

    php artisan geoip:update

And we are ready to go. **Run** the server:

    php artisan serve

**Type** on web browser:

    http://localhost:8000/

### Step 5: Start Page

Congrats! You can now register as new user and log-in.

<a name="demo-sandbox"></a>
## Demo Sandbox Fixture

If you want to try the application with a *Lorem Ipsum* database fixture.

    php artisan db:seed --class=TestingDatabaseSeeder

Now you have two demo credentials to log in and play around.

    USER: demo@timegrid.io
    PASS: demomanager

    USER: guest@example.org
    PASS: demoguest

<a name="post-install-steps"></a>
## Post-installation steps

There are some things you may need to set up after the installation is complete.

<a name="crontab-setup"></a>
### Setting up the scheduler

For *scheduled tasks* to operate correctly, you should add the following Cron entry to your server. Editing the crontab is commonly performed with the command `crontab -e`.

    * * * * * php /path/to/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

Be sure to replace **/path/to/artisan** with the absolute path to the *artisan* file in the root directory of timegrid. This Cron will call the command scheduler every minute.

> **Note**: If you are adding this to `/etc/cron.d` you'll need to specify a user immediately after `* * * * *`.
